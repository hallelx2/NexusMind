NEAR Hackathon idea
===================

THis idea is based on being able to create agents and deploy them on a blockchain, then being able to use them in a decentralised organisation. WIth this, you can have a whole bunch of agents working for you doing your bidding, all living on the blockchain.

THis application will have the following componenets:

-	You will be able to create agents
-	You will be able to sell the agents
-	You will be able to create organisations and create flows with these agents
-	There will be a marketplace for tools to include for your agents so that they can do a very goood job for you
-	You will be able to sell these organisations and make money from them.
-	A particular commission will be given to the application for using it to build your organisations

User flow for the application
-----------------------------

-	THe user comes into the app and is greeted by the landing page that tells us the things that you can do with the application
-	Then you will have a button where uou can go to the page to be able go to a guide page on how to create an organisation.
-	This will include
	-	You being able to input the name and the description of your organisation
	-	Our AI will be able to help you suggest possible agents and flow that you will need for your organisation
	-	there will be a canvas for you to pick and chain the agents to form the part of your organisation. You can add the inputs that you want each of your agents to have ant then put the outputs for the agents. Also you can say what you want the next agent in the chain will be giving you as output so that you can have this in your organisation.
-	We will also be having a chat interface from which you can brainstorm about the organisation that you want to create. THis will be a sort of rag that will be connected to the database and we will be able to query the agents that will fit the organisation that the user wants to create. This will help them automatically build agents and organisation in minutes.

Framework for building the agents
---------------------------------

For this project, I am thinking of two frameworks:

-	Crew AI, or
-	Langgraph. I am thinking langgraph as that will be able to help us create the canvas for chaining models together.

Smart contracts for this application
------------------------------------

-	There will be a smart contract to be able to create a user. This user will have agens, tools and organisations linked to him.
-	There will be contracts to sell each of these things.
-	There will be a way to add the tools to each other.
-	You will be able to add a price to each of these things that you have. Or wait. THe price of these things will change based on the number of users that you have. The more the number of those using you, the better the utility and it means that a lot of people love the things that you are doing.
-	Smart contract that collects a commission monthly from this application monthly. This will help the people use this application better.

What makes this better
----------------------

-	This application is better than other applications that just help you deploy your smart contracts online because it incorporates ai into this flow and is the future of decentralised autonomous organisations. This is a great step in the future of Blockchain and we are proud to make this work and happen.
-	With this application, we will be able to make money and so on.
-	If possible, We should also be able to create a library in python or javascript, or even rust that will help people do this easily and programmatically, hence boosting our chances of winning this hackathon.
-	The python library will be for the programmers while the gui will be for those who cannot program.

Languages to be used
--------------------

-	Typescript - For the backend of the application for interacting with the smart contract. Also, for building a framework for the agents
-	Rust - Rust will be used for creating the smart contract. Why? I love rust and rust is the ideal language for writing smart contracts
-	Python - This might also be used to create the library that can be used programmatically to interact with the smart contract.
